# match the manifest.
#
# The manifest is a JSON object of S3 key -> sha256, written by Terraform from
# the very files it uploads. Keeping the checksums in SSM instead of in user
# data means a script change never changes an instance's user data, so a
# running host is never restarted just because a script was edited.
#
# Nothing is installed until EVERY file has been downloaded and verified, so a
# bad object can never leave a half-updated set of scripts behind.
#
# The same text is embedded in the boot-time user data and in the SSM
# "refresh scripts" document, so the two can never drift apart.
