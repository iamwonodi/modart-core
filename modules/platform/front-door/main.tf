# FRONT DOOR
#
# The Cognito sign-in the team tools' web addresses sit behind (development and
# staging; production's tools are reached only through a private tunnel), and
# the function that decides who is in it.
#
# WHO IS IN IT. Everyone declared, and no one else. Declarations are JSON files
# in the deploy bucket, { "emails": [ ... ] }:
#
#   front-door/<service>.json   a service's agents; each service's role may write
#                               its own file and no other
#   front-door/_platform.json   core's platform list, written here ("_" can
#                               never begin a service's name)
#
# Whenever a declaration is created, changed or deleted, S3 invokes the function,
# which reads EVERY declaration and makes the pool's users match their union:
# one sign-in per email, however many services declare it, removed once none
# does. If any declaration cannot be read or is malformed it changes nothing,
# rather than act on part of the picture. A user added to the pool by hand is
# removed on the next run: the declarations are the only way in.
#
# No service role touches Cognito: permissions on a user pool cannot be limited
# to some of its users, so a role that could add its own people could remove
# everyone else's.
#
# WHAT IT LEAVES TO THE TOOLS REPOSITORY: the app client and its managed login
# style. They carry the tools' own web addresses.
