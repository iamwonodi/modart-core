# PEOPLE
#
# The team members who use the team tools, from infrastructure/<env>/data/
# people.json. For each person this module generates the password of their
# database login, platform.<name>, and keeps every password and access level of
# the environment in ONE secret, which only administrators read: an
# administrator hands each person their own. The logins themselves are created on the databases by the
# provisioning path (the database host in development, the functions on the
# managed databases).
#
# The list's emails also go to the front door (modules/platform/front-door),
# which gives each person a sign-in to the team tools' web addresses.
#
# TO GIVE SOMEONE A NEW DATABASE PASSWORD: replace their random_password, e.g.
# terraform apply -replace='module.people.random_password.person["ada"]'.
