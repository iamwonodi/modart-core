  # CONTENT TYPE MAP
  #
  # Maps a file extension (lowercase, leading dot included) to the
  # Content-Type each matching object is served with from S3.
  #
  # Anything not listed here falls back to "application/octet-stream" in
  # main.tf's lookup() call. That fallback isn't a silent no-op -- browsers
  # generally treat octet-stream as "download this" rather than "render
  # this", and are strict enough about font MIME types specifically that a
  # missing entry here can mean images that won't display inline or
  # @font-face fonts a browser refuses to load, not just a cosmetic gap.
  #
  # Extend this list as new file types show up in the assets repository --
  # it's deliberately broader than what's in the assets repo today, so
  # adding a new file type there usually won't require a matching change
  # here too.
