# EC2 AUTO-RECOVERY
#
# The database is a single stateful instance, not a fleet -- an Auto
# Scaling Group is the wrong recovery mechanism here specifically because
# the data volume is a separately Terraform-managed EBS resource attached
# by instance_id. An ASG-driven replacement instance would need that
# volume reattached by something outside Terraform's own apply cycle,
# since ASG replacement happens on AWS's own schedule, not Terraform's.
#
# EC2 auto-recovery is the correct fit instead: on a system status check
# failure (the underlying hardware is impaired), AWS migrates this exact
# instance to new hardware, preserving the same instance ID, private IP,
# and attached EBS volumes -- confirmed directly against AWS's own
# documentation. Concretely, that means: no DNS re-registration needed
# (the private IP doesn't change, so the record below stays correct), no
# volume reattachment needed (stays attached automatically), and no
# script changes needed at all (docker-compose.yml already sets
# "restart: unless-stopped", so Docker brings the database containers
# back up on its own once the instance reboots).
#
# This does not cover every possible failure: it only triggers on a
# system-level status check failure (impaired underlying hardware), not
# an OS-level hang that doesn't trip that check, and not an accidental
# manual termination (a terminated instance cannot be recovered).
#
# Cost: this is a single standard-resolution alarm on a built-in EC2
# metric. The first 10 standard alarms per account/region are free, and
# built-in AWS service metrics (unlike custom application metrics) never
# have their own per-metric charge. The 300-second period below matches
# EC2's free "basic monitoring" reporting interval, so this alarm incurs
# no cost at all under typical use -- enabling "detailed monitoring"
# (1-minute) would allow a shorter period for faster detection, at
# roughly $2.10/instance/month, but is not required for this alarm to
# function correctly.

# AUTOMATED BACKUPS
#
# Daily EBS snapshots of the persistent data volume via DLM (Data
# Lifecycle Manager), not AWS Backup -- deliberately the lighter tool.
# AWS Backup's extra features (cross-region copy, centralized
# multi-account policies, legal-hold vaults) are aimed at production
# compliance and DR needs this development environment doesn't have.
#
# This backs up the VOLUME at the block level -- crash-consistent, not
# application-consistent (equivalent to recovering from a sudden power
# loss, not a clean shutdown). Modern journaling engines (InnoDB,
# Postgres WAL, WiredTiger) generally recover fine from that, but it is
# a real distinction from a coordinated database-level backup.
#
# This also cannot restore just one service team's data in isolation --
# a restore brings back the whole volume, every engine and every team
# together, since multiple teams' databases share this one host and
# volume. If that granular, per-team restore need becomes real, the
# next step is per-team logical dumps (mysqldump/pg_dump/mongodump) to
# S3 alongside this, not a replacement for it.
