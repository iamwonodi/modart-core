# DATABASE HOST BOOTSTRAP (user data)
#
#   Phase 1 - Prepare the persistent data volume (format on first use, mount,
#             persist in fstab).
#   Phase 2 - Create the database workspace and data root.
#   Phase 3 - Install the rendered runtime .env file.
#   Phase 4 - Download and verify the platform scripts (update.sh, provision.sh
#             and the shared deploy library) from the deploy bucket.
#   Phase 5 - Run the first deploy of whatever engines the platforms team has
#             published.
#
# This file is deliberately small. EC2 caps user data at 16 KB, so the scripts
# live in S3 and are verified against a checksum manifest in SSM. The manifest
# -- not this file -- carries the checksums, so editing a script never changes
# this user data and never restarts the database host. To refresh the scripts on
# a running host, send the <project>-database-refresh-scripts SSM document.
#
# Which engines run is decided entirely by the platforms team's registry (see
# update.sh); nothing here knows about any particular database engine.
