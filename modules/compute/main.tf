# SECRET ROTATION -> AUTOMATIC REDEPLOY
#
# Without this, a service team enabling automatic rotation on their own
# secret has no way to get that change actually picked up -- update.sh
# only ever runs at boot, or whenever someone manually triggers it again.
#
# Uses AWS's own recommended mechanism: the native "Secret Label Updated"
# event (delivered directly to EventBridge, not derived from CloudTrail,
# enabled by default for every secret -- confirmed against AWS's current
# documentation, not assumed), matched specifically on the AWSCURRENT
# label moving, which fires for both a manual secret update and an
# automatic rotation alike.
#
# This can't be scoped to "only this project's fleet secrets" via a real
# resource tag -- EventBridge event patterns only match the event's own
# JSON fields, not tags looked up separately on the resource that
# triggered it. True tag-based filtering would require an intermediate
# Lambda calling DescribeSecret to check tags before deciding whether to
# proceed -- a deliberate choice not to add that here. Instead, this is
# scoped by a NAMING CONVENTION: any secret intended to trigger a fleet
# redeploy must be named starting with
# "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-fleet-" (e.g.
# "core-development-fleet-auth-db"). EventBridge's own prefix-match
# syntax on the event's "name" field (confirmed against AWS's current
# documentation) makes this filter real, not just a convention nobody
# enforces at the trigger level.
#
# Targets BOTH fleets by their shared Project/Environment tags (not a
# specific Service tag) since update.sh is safe to run on any instance
# regardless of whether that particular instance actually has the
# affected service deployed -- it just re-syncs and re-resolves
# everything, and is a harmless no-op for services not present there.
