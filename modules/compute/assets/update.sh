# ==============================================================================
# FLEET DEPLOY ENGINE
#
# 1. Syncs team-provided service directories from THIS TIER'S OWN prefix
#    within the fleet deploy bucket (--delete, so a team removing their
#    service cleans it up here too).
# 2. Discovers every service by presence: any subdirectory holding both a
#    docker-compose.yml (or .yaml) and a .env is deployed. There is no
#    manifest and no "active" flag -- removing either file is how a team takes
#    their service out of rotation.
# 3. Stops any service whose directory has disappeared from the bucket, before
#    the sync removes the local copy. Without this an S3 deletion removes the
#    files while the containers keep running indefinitely: "--remove-orphans"
#    only reaches within a single Compose project, not across separate ones.
# 4. For each service: resolves __FROM_SECRET__ references into a throwaway
#    scratch copy of its env file, checks the compose file against the compose
#    guard, deploys using that copy, then deletes it immediately.
#
# The shared pieces -- lock, jitter, ECR login, secret resolution, compose
# guard -- live in deploy-lib.sh next to this file, which is also used by the
# database host's update script.
#
# LAYOUT -- one directory per service:
#
#   <tier>/<service>/docker-compose.yml
#   <tier>/<service>/.env
#   <tier>/<service>/data/**
#
# Each service's compose file is run with its own directory as the Compose
# project directory, so relative paths inside it ("./data", ".resolved/.env")
# resolve against that service's own directory. The compose guard rejects any
# bind mount that leaves that directory.
#
# Re-runnable at any time -- re-syncs and re-resolves everything fresh on every
# invocation, whether that is the boot-time deploy or a later triggered update.
#
# JITTER_SECONDS (optional, environment): the maximum random delay before
# deploying. The secret-rotation trigger sets it so hosts do not all recreate a
# container at the same instant.

#
# The resolved env file is passed BOTH ways on purpose:
#   --env-file  supplies ${VAR} interpolation into the compose file
#   env_file:   (declared in the compose file) injects into the container
# They are separate mechanisms; --env-file alone puts nothing inside the
# container, which is the single most common way this goes wrong.
#
# One service failing must not prevent the rest of the fleet from deploying --
# a co-tenant's broken config is not this host's problem. Failures are
# collected and reported at the end, and still fail the run so the SSM command
# surfaces as errored.
