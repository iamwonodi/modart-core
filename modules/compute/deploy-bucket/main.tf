# FLEET CONFIG BUCKET
#
# Holds team-provided compose files and env files (one <service>-compose.yml
# and one <service>.env per service). Every fleet instance -- new or
# existing -- syncs this down before deploying anything, which is what
# makes a scale-out event work correctly: a brand-new instance gets the
# identical set of files as every other instance, rather than starting
# with nothing.
#
# Deliberately S3, not EBS: an EBS volume can only be attached to one
# instance at a time, which is the right shape for the database's
# single-host persistent storage but the wrong shape here -- every fleet
# instance needs to read the SAME shared files simultaneously. S3 is a
# shared, multi-reader resource by nature, which is exactly the property
# this needs.
