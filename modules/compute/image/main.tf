# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GOLDEN AMI
#
# One image per environment, built by CORE and used by every host in it: the
# shared fleets in development, and each service's own hosts in staging and
# production.
#
# Core owns it rather than each service building its own, because patching is
# the argument that decides it: a CVE fix is then one rebuild, not one per
# service, and the image nobody remembers to rebuild is the one that stays
# vulnerable. Nothing in the image varies per service either -- it is a container
# host, and the application arrives as a container.
#
# The AMI ID is published as an SSM parameter rather than handed out as a value.
# A service's launch template reads the parameter, so core rebuilding the image
# gives that service a new launch template version on its next plan. A value
# copied once would freeze every service on whatever was current that day.
