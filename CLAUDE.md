# Working on this repository

This is a **blueprint**: many projects clone it. Never commit anything project-specific (repository names or IDs, domains, account IDs). Per-project values ship as `CHANGE_ME`.

## Ground rules

- **Never run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`**, or any AWS-mutating command, unless asked in that specific request. `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` are fine.
- Read the real files, and the modules a file calls, before proposing a change; defects here have lived in the seam between two files that each looked right. Verify against provider documentation rather than recalling.
- Classify review findings CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / OPTIONAL, say PASS when something is correct, and do not rewrite working code for style.
- Comments explain why, not what. Scripts are exercised against real inputs and their error paths before they are called done.
- Keep the smallest change that is correct. Do not add variables or features without a use case.

## Layout

`modules/` holds the four infrastructure domains — `network`, `edge`, `compute` (`image/` for the golden AMI and `deploy-bucket/`, both used by every environment), `database` (`host/` for development, `provisioning/` for the managed instance) — and `platform/`, which holds what is not infrastructure: `identity`, `service-roles`, `service-boundary`, `engines-role`, `contract`, `people` (the platform list's database logins), `front-door` (the tools' sign-in and the function that fills it), `tools-role` (the team-tools repository's CI role) and `host-scripts`. A module used by exactly one domain is nested inside it (`edge/cloudfront`, `network/nacl-security`).

## Architecture in one paragraph

Each environment is its own AWS account. `network` builds the VPC and tiers, `edge` the DNS, ALBs, CloudFront and assets bucket, `compute` two shared fleets (private and internal) plus the deploy bucket and deploy engine, `database` one database host. Services deploy by publishing `<tier>/<service>/docker-compose.yml` and `.env` to the deploy bucket and sending the fleet-update SSM document. Everything a service needs to know is in the SSM parameter `/<project>/platform/config` ([docs/platform-contract.md](docs/platform-contract.md)). The decision log is [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md).

## Conventions

- Terraform `>= 1.6.0`; AWS provider `>= 6.0.0, < 7.0.0`. The version CI uses is `.terraform-version`.
- File layout: every top-level `locals` block in `locals.tf`, every `data` block in `data.tf`, resources and module calls in `main.tf` (or a file named for its domain); a module that creates nothing has no `main.tf`. Workflows run on `ubuntu-24.04`, never `ubuntu-latest`. `scripts/ci/check-file-layout.sh` fails CI otherwise.
- Cross-variable invariants are `terraform_data` preconditions, never `check` blocks (a failed check only warns).
- Modules that need no AWS have `terraform test` suites. Host scripts have offline tests against stubbed `aws`/`docker`/`gh`.
- SSM paths carry no environment segment. S3 bucket names do.
- Generated secrets use only letters, digits and `-_.`.
- Commits are conventional (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`), and the tree stays `terraform fmt` clean.

## Environments

A project runs any subset of development, staging and production, listed in `environments.json` (set by `scripts/init-project.sh --environments`). Anything that acts on an environment asks `scripts/ci/enabled-environments.sh` (list, `--check ENV`, `--filter JSON`); never assume all three exist.

## Open items

- The dedicated-hosting policy (staging and production) is a first draft that has never been exercised against AWS; the first real plan will show any missing action. It is 9.6 KB of a 10.2 KB limit, so the next statements added to it will need managed policies.
- Managed-database provisioning (`database/provisioning`, a VPC Lambda) is tested offline and against a local PostgreSQL; TLS and SCRAM against real RDS are unverified.
- Staging and production declare every engine and run only those in their `database_engines`. Each active engine gets its own provisioning function (PostgreSQL and MySQL tested against real servers with `PROVISION_TEST_PG_HOST` / `PROVISION_TEST_MYSQL_HOST`; DocumentDB offline only). `mongodb` runs on `terraform-aws-documentdb`, which must be readable by core's CI (public, like the other modules). MongoDB users live in `admin` in every environment. Every provisioning connection verifies the server's certificate and host name against `modules/database/provisioning/lambda/certificates/rds-global-bundle.pem` (committed; `scripts/ci/check-ca-bundle.sh` checks it). Development and staging use a NAT instance (`nat_type`), production a NAT Gateway; the NAT instance and routing v1.1.0 modules are published and public like the others. The internal tier is off by default everywhere (`internal_tier_enabled`): no internal load balancer, development's internal fleet at zero, and no `internal` entry in the contract or service roles. Staging's `database_schedule` is `always_on` (the default, as production always is) or `working_hours` (`modules/database/schedule`: EventBridge Scheduler starts the instances on the chosen days and stops them daily). The schedules have never run against AWS.
- Nothing here has been applied to real AWS. The first apply will validate what offline tests cannot: provider arguments, IAM condition keys, and the Docker and AWS behaviour the script tests stub. `docs/first-real-run.md` lists what to watch, across every repository, in the order you meet it.
- Every `infrastructure/<env>/.terraform.lock.hcl` is committed, locked for every platform (`terraform providers lock -platform=windows_amd64 -platform=linux_amd64 -platform=darwin_amd64 -platform=darwin_arm64`). CI fails without it, and every environment init is `-lockfile=readonly`: after adding a provider or a module that brings one, re-lock and commit before pushing.
- Names: `<project>-<environment>-<service>-<resource>` for anything with a service, `<project>-<environment>-<resource>` otherwise; SSM documents and parameter paths omit the environment. The secret and the target group are the one exception (`<project>-<service>-<environment>-...`, from `secrets-vault` and `target-group` v1): keep them behind `service_first_prefix` in `service-roles` until both modules release a v2. `fleet` names only the shared fleet's own things; `shared` and `dedicated` are the hosting models. Always say **port registry** or **ECR registry**, never "the registry".
