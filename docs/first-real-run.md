# The first real run: what to watch

Everything here has been built and tested offline (mocked AWS, fake command-line tools, real PostgreSQL and MySQL for the database logins), but none of it has run against real AWS. This is what only a real run can prove, across every repository, in the order you meet it. Tick each as it passes; when one fails, the note says where to look.

## 0. Before the first apply

- [ ] Every repository has its pending bundles applied and pushed.
- [ ] Every pinned module version exists on GitHub (checked on 2026-09-25: all 32).
- [ ] `environments.json` (core) and each repository's `.github/environments.json` list the same environments or fewer.

## 1. Core, development first (`docs/first-apply.md`)

- [ ] **The first plan** of a fresh environment: provider arguments, and every `for_each` keyed by names known at plan time (the modules fixed for this were released as nacl-security v1.0.2, profile v1.1.1, rds-instance v1.0.1, documentdb v1.0.1; the first real development plan then found six more, fixed in acm v1.0.1, s3 v1.0.1, vpc-endpoints v1.0.1, load-balancer v1.1.0, compute v1.2.0 and compute-storage v1.2.0, with each fix covered by a plan test in its module). The first development apply then found three more: security group and rule descriptions with an apostrophe (which AWS refuses; the NAT instance's outbound rule was one, so nothing in the private and internal tiers reached the internet and the golden image could not build), load balancer listeners created before their certificate was issued, and Lambda packages built by the plan but missing from the apply job. Fixed in security-group v2.0.0, sg-ingress-rule v1.2.2, sg-egress-rule v2.0.1 and nat-instance v1.0.1, which now reject such descriptions at plan time. The second apply then showed the private and internal tiers had no internet access through the NAT at all: their network ACLs allowed web traffic only to and from the public subnets, but a packet routed through the NAT keeps the internet host's address. They now allow it to and from the internet; the security groups and the NAT route still decide what can connect. The NAT instance could not reach Session Manager either, since the VPC endpoints' private DNS covers it and their security group did not admit it; now it does.
- [ ] **The golden image builds** with Docker, Compose, the AWS CLI and Python (staging and production now set them, like development).
- [ ] **The network:** a request through CloudFront reaches a service (the load balancers' outbound rules); the database host is reachable by SSM, fetches its scripts from S3 and pulls from ECR (the isolated tier's outbound rules and network ACL).
- [ ] **The database host** (development) starts, and the engines repository's first deploy runs (section 2).
- [ ] **Staging and production:** RDS and DocumentDB are created; the provisioning functions reach their database and Secrets Manager (they wear the isolated group), verify TLS and authenticate (SCRAM on PostgreSQL). Staging's `working_hours` schedule starts and stops the databases.
- [ ] **The dedicated-hosting policy** (service roles, staging and production) is a first draft: the first service apply may name a missing action. Each role's permissions are managed policies under `/platform/service-roles/` (8 statements each), so an added action has room.
- [ ] **The front door** (development, staging): the Cognito pool exists; writing `front-door/_platform.json` invokes the front-door function (its logs show the reconciliation).
- [ ] **Provision People** (the apply's last step) creates the `platform.` logins on each engine.

## 2. The engines repository (development only)

- [ ] `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` with a referenced security group and tags works under the engines role, including the rules from the team-tools group.
- [ ] Each engine's healthcheck passes inside `compose up --wait`; MongoDB's first boot (its temporary init server can answer early).
- [ ] A changed administrator password does not reach running engines (known limitation: the images read it only on first boot).

## 3. The first service (`aws-service-infra-b1`)

- [ ] Dedicated hosting (staging, production): the boundary allows what the hosts need; the launch template's `block_device_mappings`; `jq` on the image.
- [ ] Provisioning creates the service's database, then its **agents** (`<service>.<name>`) and brings the **platform list** up to date. On RDS MySQL, the master user may `REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION` and grant per database (simulated offline with its documented privileges). On DocumentDB, `readAnyDatabase` / `read` roles (offline only).
- [ ] In production, an agent asking for `write` without core's approval stops provisioning with its message.
- [ ] Administrator password (development): replace it (runbook, *Changing an administrator password*) and apply; the apply's last step logs that MySQL's (and MongoDB's) was the previous one and is now the current one, and a service provisions afterwards. In staging, replace one engine's and check the next provisioning signs in; DocumentDB's changes without waiting for the maintenance window.
- [ ] Connection caps: on PostgreSQL `SELECT rolname, rolconnlimit FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname NOT LIKE 'pg\_%'` shows the service's cap and each person's; on MySQL `SELECT user, max_user_connections FROM mysql.user`. On RDS the master user may set both (proven offline against a non-superuser administrator shaped like it). Opening one more connection than a person's cap is refused.
- [ ] The front-door declaration (`front-door/<service>.json`) gives each agent a sign-in, and Cognito's invitation arrives.
- [ ] A plan in an environment core does not run stops at "Check Core Runs This Environment".

## 4. The app (`django-service-app-b1`)

- [ ] The first release: semantic-release tags it (the commit-message check keeps messages readable to it), the image builds and pushes, and development deploys.
- [ ] Dedicated hosting: the hosts carry `Service=<service>` and answer the service's own document.
- [ ] Promotion: staging (or the next environment listed) accepts only a tag that ran below it.

## 5. The team tools (`aws-team-tools-b1`)

- [ ] **The image tags exist on Docker Hub:** `dbgate/dbgate:7.3.1`, `dbeaver/cloudbeaver:25.3.5` (taken from the projects' release tags; not checked against Docker Hub).
- [ ] **A server starts:** Start tools, then `/var/log/team-tools-start.log`: the RDS bundle's checksum passes, MySQL's truststore is built, both containers run.
- [ ] **The sign-in:** `https://dbgate.<domain>` sends you to Cognito's managed login; a new user sets a password **and an authenticator app** (documented for Essentials; not yet seen for invited users); the load balancer reaches Cognito's token endpoint.
- [ ] **CloudBeaver** configures its administrator from `CB_ADMIN_NAME` / `CB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (no setup page), shows the prepared connections, and connects to MySQL over TLS with the built truststore.
- [ ] **DbGate** connects to every engine with your own login; **writes to DocumentDB** work (`retryWrites=false` rides in the port field).
- [ ] The schedule starts and stops the server; Start tools books the stop two hours later in UTC.

## 6. The tunnel (`aws-identity-b1`)

- [ ] IAM Identity Center is enabled, and "Send email OTP" is on.
- [ ] `scripts/bootstrap.sh` creates the role; the first Apply creates the users, groups and the `TeamToolsTunnel` assignment.
- [ ] A new person's first sign-in sends the verification email, and they set a password and two-factor sign-in.
- [ ] `aws ssm start-session ... AWS-StartPortForwardingSession` to the tools server works; a shell session (`aws ssm start-session --target ...` with no document) is refused; another instance is refused.
