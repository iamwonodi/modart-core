# RENDER DESTROY PLAN SUMMARY
#
# Prints Markdown summarizing a destroy plan for a given environment. The
# caller redirects this into $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY. If a plan text file is
# given and exists, its content is included (truncated defensively so an
# enormous plan can't blow past GitHub's step summary size limit);
# otherwise this reports that there was nothing to destroy.
#
# Usage:
#   render-destroy-plan-summary.sh <environment> <has-changes:true|false> [plan-text-file]
